Simple Banking System in Python
--------------------------------

Project Description:
This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a simple banking system. The program allows a user to check balance, deposit money, withdraw funds, and exit the system. It runs in a loop until the user chooses to quit, making it an interactive console-based application.

Features:
- Show current account balance
- Deposit money (with invalid amount check)
- Withdraw money (with insufficient balance check)
- Menu-driven interface
- Easy for first-year students

Concepts Used:
- Functions
- Variables
- Loops (while)
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- User input handling

How to Run the Program:
1. Install Python (if not installed) from the official website.
2. Save the code in a file named:
   banking_program.py
3. Run the script using:
   python banking_program.py

Important Note:
Your code currently uses:
if name == 'main':
It must be:
if _name_ == '_main_':
Otherwise, the program will NOT run.

Future Enhancements (Optional):
- Save balance permanently using a file
- Add PIN login system
- Add transaction history
- GUI using Tkinter

Suitable For:
- First year CSE students
- Python beginners
- Mini projects
- GitHub uploads
