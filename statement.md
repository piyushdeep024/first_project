Banking Program – Statement File
1. Problem Statement

A common requirement, for beginning programmers and users with needs for light banking tools at the console, involves managing simple financial transactions like checking balances, depositing money, and withdrawing funds. This project simulates basic banking operations in a clear manner, without real systems of finance involved. It helps users interact with core banking functions while allowing programmers to practice input handling, conditional logic, and function design.

2. Scope of the Project

This project focuses on the implementation of the essential banking operations in a text-based interface. It covers:

Displays the user's current balance

Accept deposit amounts and update the account:

Allowing withdrawals while preventing negative balances

Graceful Handling of Invalid Inputs

Running as a continuous loop until the user chooses to exit.

Advanced banking features like authentication, storing data persistently, calculating interest, or multiple user support are currently out of scope.

3. Target Users

Beginner programmers interested in learning basic concepts such as functions, loops, and input validation.

Students working on introductory programming assignments.

Users who want a simple simulation of some banking operations for practice or demonstration purposes.

Educators looking for an easy example to teach basic program structure and user interaction.

4. High-Level Features

Balance Display: This indicates the user's current account balance, formatted to two decimal places.

Deposit Function: that receives input from the user, checks for invalid amount, and updates the balance.

Withdrawal Function: This is in place to ensure adequate funds are available, and also to block withdrawals that are invalid or negative.

Menu-driven Interface: Simple numbered options for smooth navigation.

Input Validation: Handles invalid choices and inappropriate amounts with clear feedback.

Looping Operation: Continues to run until the user desires termination.
